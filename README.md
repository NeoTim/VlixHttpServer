Vlix Http Server
================

**Vlix Http Server** is a simple and lightweight http server used to serve static file content. This means any directory on your PC can be turned into a web server to serve files such as 'html'. Even though it is lightweight Vlix Http Server is enterprise and production ready, as it supports:

- Multi threaded request processing.

- Content Caching

  

These features allow the Vlix Http Server to serve thousands of request with ease, without latency.

> The Vlix Http Server is part of **Vlix** (http://vlix.me). **Vlix** overall is an Industrial Data Platform which uses this Http Server to serve content from it's back end. ðŸ˜ƒ



Vlix Http Server targets the **DotNet Framework**, which lacks a dedicated web server like Kestrel for DotNet Core.
